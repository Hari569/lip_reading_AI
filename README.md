# Lip Reading AI

## Overview
This project develops an AI system capable of recognizing spoken words by analyzing lip movements from video data.

## Dataset
Custom or publicly available lip-reading datasets (e.g., GRID, LRW). Ensure the data is preprocessed into frame sequences for modeling.

## Methodology
- Frame extraction from videos
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction
- Recurrent layers (LSTM/GRU) for sequence modeling
- CTC loss for mapping lip movements to characters/words

## Results
The model achieves [insert metric] accuracy on the validation set.
